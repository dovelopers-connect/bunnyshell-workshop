# Definitions

Kubernetes is a tool that allows you to [run](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#run) workloads in a cluster of computers called nodes. It automates deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications \[1].

Workloads are abstracted as [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/), the most atomical element of the kubernetes architecture, that can group one or more containers.
